The SpeechToText project is a service I developed to convert spoken language into text, making it a valuable tool for various applications. 
The main goal of this service is to streamline the integration of speech recognition capabilities into other projects, enabling seamless voice-to-text functionality across different platforms.
I designed this service with flexibility in mind, ensuring that it can be easily implemented into existing applications. Whether it's for transcribing audio, building voice-driven commands, or enhancing accessibility features, SpeechToText can be quickly integrated into any project to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience.
This project leverages state-of-the-art speech recognition technologies, delivering high accuracy and fast response times. By making SpeechToText a standalone service, Iâ€™ve ensured that it can be reused and adapted to meet the specific needs of different projects, saving time and effort for developers.
